# physics_307
This repository has all of the code from the Physics 307 course at UW-Madison, which is the Intermediate Physics Lab. I took this course during the Spring 2023 semester. While it recommended that we use Qti-Plot for the data analysis in this course, I found it easiest to do using Jupyter Notebooks. 

Over the course of this semester, we conducted six labs, each taking a period of 2 weeks. The schedule and project titles are found here:

Weeks 1-2: Elements of Gamma-Ray Counting and Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy 

Weeks 3-4: Probability Distributions and the Decay of Excited Quantum States 

Weeks 5-6: Attenuation of Gamma-Rays in Matter

Weeks 7-8: Cavendish Measurement of the Gravitational Constant

Weeks 9-10: Planck Distribution Law and the Stefan Boltzmann Law

Weeks 11-12: Introduction to X-Ray Physics and Diffraction

All of the data was collected in the lab and saved to .csv files, which I analyzed on my local machine. Based on our lab manuals, we were instructed to produce various plots, all of which were saved from these Jupyter Notebooks. I also conducted as much error propagation through these Jupyter Notebooks as was possible. Then based on the calculations and experimental processes, the rest of the errors were calculated manually.
